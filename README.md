Manifesto Text Files Folder:
  Contains the text files (converted) which will be used for analysis.
  
Manifesto Source Files:
  Contains the source files.
  Most manifesto files were taken from: http://www.cpdi-pakistan.org/party-manifestos
  PML-N manifesto taken from: http://pmo.gov.pk/documents/manifesto.pdf
  JI manifesto taken from: https://kurzman.unc.edu/files/2011/06/JI_2013_English.pdf
  
  PML-N different source because cpdi source had images instead of text.
  JI different because no English version on cpdi.
